# KaggleProjects
These are the projects that I have done on Kaggle

1.) Heart Attack Prediction by Logistic Regression

2.) CarDekho Car Selling Price Point Prediction by Linear Regression

3.) Likelihood of Getting Admit from US Universities by Linear, Lasso, Ridge and ElasticNet Regression. I have also applied Decision trees and Random Forest.

4.) Hate Crime Analysis which is Exploratory Data Analysis and no model is used as such.
