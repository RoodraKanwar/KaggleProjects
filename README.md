# KaggleProjects
These are the projects that I have done on Kaggle

1.) Heart Attack Prediction by Logistic Regression

2.) CarDekho Car Selling Price Point Prediction by Linear Regression

3.) Likelihood of Getting Admit from US Universities by Linear, Lasso, Ridge and ElasticNet Regression. I have also applied Decision trees and Random Forest.

4.) Hate Crime Analysis which is Exploratory Data Analysis and no model is used as such.

5.) Exploratory Data Analysis is done on US police killings of civillians. No model training is done.

6.) Data Analysis and Model training is done on Heart attack dataset. This was different from the above dataset and a lot more number of Classification of models were used. The models inclued Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian NB, Multinomial NB, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors.
